# CIT43100Auth
Salter + SHA256 Hasher Demo for CIT43100 Final

## How to run
I tried to make it as simple for demo purposes for the instructor or anyone interested in running the application,
please run main.py as it includes everything and will run in the command like

### Do I need a VENV or install anything?
I ensured that everything is a basic package, so no VENV is needed for running this, unless you are going to fork and make additions for your own demo!

### Where is the data stored
The data is tored on pythonsqlite.db, it is included in the .gitignore, so it should not be pushed up unless the name is changed in directory or code.

###### Usage
Please feel free to use for whatever besides IUPUI CIT43100 final if you find this. I do not codone plagerism or cheating, but I believe in open souce code...
